# python-challenge
Throughout this module we used python scripting to complete two real world challenges (PyPoll and PyBank).
In the each challenge we were given a dataset and tasked to both create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company
and help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
The two python scripts are recorded in the file as PyBank.py and PyPoll.py and the printed out terminal results are titled FinAnalysis and PyPoll Results.
